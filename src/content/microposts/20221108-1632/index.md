<p>Some words about our little <a href="https://mastodon.bofhers.es/tags/community" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>community</span></a>...</p><p>In the beginning I was curious about the challenge to host a <a href="https://mastodon.bofhers.es/tags/mastodon" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>mastodon</span></a> instance, then I was a bit worried because of the data responsibility and everything. Now, after chatting and dealing with little problems here and there, I must say  I&#39;m glad I did that.</p><p>And proud, because <a href="https://mastodon.bofhers.es/tags/bofhers" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>bofhers</span></a> understand that this is a hobby and afaik they understand what <a href="https://mastodon.bofhers.es/tags/fediverse" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>fediverse</span></a> + decentralized means + they&#39;re offering hand when some help is needed.</p><p>❤️ </p><p><a href="https://mastodon.bofhers.es/tags/micropost" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>micropost</span></a></p>
