<p>The other day a friend of mine asked if I&#39;d noted some problem or high load in our little <a href="https://mastodon.bofhers.es/tags/mastodon" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>mastodon</span></a> instance. I said no, but then I took a look at <a href="https://mastodon.bofhers.es/tags/sidekiq" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>sidekiq</span></a>, and it seemed that -definitely- something was occurring in the background.</p><p>This instance has been installed on 2022-05-26 in a little server,  on 2022-09-09 it was migrated to v.3.5.3 and on 2022-09-24 I&#39;ve bought a new -bigger- server.</p><p>- Media storage: 30Gb.<br />- Postgres storage: 400Mb.<br />- Redis storage: 20Mb.</p><p>That&#39;s the toy. <a href="https://mastodon.bofhers.es/tags/micropost" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>micropost</span></a></p>
