<p>When I created this <a href="https://mastodon.bofhers.es/tags/mastodon" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>mastodon</span></a> account, I thought of building a new bubble, from scratch; perhaps too focused on the technical aspects of my daily work (<a href="https://mastodon.bofhers.es/tags/dev" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>dev</span></a>, <a href="https://mastodon.bofhers.es/tags/sys" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>sys</span></a>, etc... a mistake).</p><p>It hasn&#39;t quite captured my interest, and I miss &quot;other topics&quot;. Lately, I&#39;ve also been logging into <a href="https://mastodon.bofhers.es/tags/twitter" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>twitter</span></a>, but as of today, I can&#39;t stand the ads.</p><p>Perhaps it&#39;s worth one last attempt to change the bubble but I suppose I&#39;ve lost the &#39;engagement&#39; with both platforms.</p><p><a href="https://mastodon.bofhers.es/tags/micropost" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>micropost</span></a></p>
