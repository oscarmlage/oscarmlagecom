<p>I admit I have a love/hate relationship with microposting. On one hand, with
    platforms like Mastodon, it's very easy to use to generate written content
    and accompany it with a couple of photos/videos. On the other hand, I don't
    like the idea of content getting lost or handing it over to third parties
    (Twitter, cough cough)</p>

<p>The solution I came up with some time ago to not lose certain posts is to add a <a href="https://mastodon.bofhers.es/tags/micropost" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>micropost</span></a> tag to them and import them into a section within my blog using a small program that takes that feed and transforms it into markdown importable in <a href="https://mastodon.bofhers.es/tags/hugo" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>hugo</span></a>... </p><p>I think I'm going to write a proper post about this: <a href="/posts/microposting-obs2hugo-go/">obs2hugo.go</a></p>
