Today I remembered that summer, when I was a child, in the village when I saw a Macintosh Classic for the first time. Being used to MSX/Spectrum, it was something new to me. [#TIR](https://mastodon.bofhers.es/tags/TIR)

It belonged to a neighbour, Ramiro, who was older than me; he barely used it as a word processor and not much else. I think it was the first time I held a mouse... probably when I started to hate them ðŸ˜‚ [#TIR](https://mastodon.bofhers.es/tags/TIR)
