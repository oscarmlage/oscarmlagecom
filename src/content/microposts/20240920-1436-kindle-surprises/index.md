Suddenly, all the books in my Kindle disappeared, which was kind of scary. I connected it to my computer, opened Calibre, and the books seemed to be fine on the device. After disconnecting it, the library was able to load again. I thought I had lost all my reading progress, but it seems to be fine in the end.
