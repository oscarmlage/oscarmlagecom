Mastodon / Bluesky: After a few days of using both apps in parallel, I see strengths and weaknesses in each; I can't choose one over the other, so what I didn’t want to happen is probably going to happen: I’ll end up using both. I don’t think this will double my social media time, but I don’t think it’s ideal either.
