I just realized that [@things](https://mastodon.bofhers.es/@things@mastodon.online "@things@mastodon.online"), my favorite task management software, has a Mastodon account!

It’s a pity they’re not as active here as on other social networks… but it’s worth following them, just in case.

* Update: [@things](https://mastodon.bofhers.es/@things@mastodon.online "@things@mastodon.online") Oh, they’re just as active as on other platforms—it was my instance playing tricks on me.
