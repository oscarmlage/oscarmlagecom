One of my kids wanted to dress up as a mortgage because it’s the most terrifying thing for an adult.

However, he finally decided to go as one of the guards from Squid Game. The other wants to go as a 'monster bear,' but I have a feeling it’s just an excuse to wear the mask because it looked like something from Minecraft.

…unlike me, who’s dressing up as a certified Terraform expert but still in **plan** mode.
