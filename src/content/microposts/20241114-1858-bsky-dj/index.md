Have I taken on too much by building a timeline reader directly from my [#PDS](https://mastodon.bofhers.es/tags/PDS)? Not sure if it's too much, but I wanted to refresh my [#Django](https://mastodon.bofhers.es/tags/Django) skills, and one thing led to another. Images aren't showing yet, and I can't interact with the timeline, but you have to start somewhere... I guess.
