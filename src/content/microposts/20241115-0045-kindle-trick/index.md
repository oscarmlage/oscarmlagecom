[#Kindle](https://mastodon.bofhers.es/tags/Kindle) Book, tap near the top of the page to open up the Menu. Then, tap on the “Aa” symbol.  
   
Then, tap on where you see “More”.  
   
From there, you will see an option for “Reading Progress”. Tap on that. You’re welcome.

I always forget where it is!
