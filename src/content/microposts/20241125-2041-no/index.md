Today, I said NO to a customer. I think it’s the first time I’ve done it so explicitly. They’ve been trying for months to push me into a space where I feel anything but comfortable, and I realized it wouldn’t be good for either of us. I still feel a bit weird about it... guess it’s just lack of practice.
