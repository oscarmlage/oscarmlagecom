I’m glad my new bathroom doesn’t —afaik— have anything that does tracking, because I’m sure it would also do the [#wrapped](https://mastodon.bofhers.es/tags/wrapped) thing:

- Total time spent: 72 hours.  
- Most played song in the shower: \[Insert your favorite hit here].  
- Most used product: Anti-hair-loss shampoo.  
- Average nighttime visits: 1.5 times per week.

Maybe it would even include a ranking of your most epic shower moments... Written from the bathroom, obvs.
