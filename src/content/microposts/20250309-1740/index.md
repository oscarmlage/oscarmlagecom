Yesterday I ‘finished’ Path of Exile 2. These games don’t have a defined ending, but you either set a limit or they become an endless thing. I wanted to complete an endgame ‘C citadel’ (tier XV with a +1 monsters mod, which should be equivalent to a T.XVI if I’m not wrong). Now, I’ll just wait for the next season.
