Today I was invited to a dinner for an old video game podcast I collaborated with. I don’t really fit in because I’m—by a huge margin—the least knowledgeable and involved in the topic.

I just wanted to drop by and say that I had an absolute blast. Saying thanks for this kind of invitation doesn’t feel like enough.
