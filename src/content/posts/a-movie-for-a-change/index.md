Yesterday, we were so bored scrolling to find a series to start, in a total lazy mood, that we ended up choosing a movie. It's been so long since the last time I can't even remember.

We usually watch series because the episodes are shorter, though it's a bit of a trap because we end up watching more than one, but mentally it feels like less of a commitment. We've split the movie into 2 parts, and today we're finishing it.

Maybe it'll become a regular thing. If it does, perhaps it's a good idea to keep track of that kind of thing.
