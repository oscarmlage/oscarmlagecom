<p>I used to be a person that perfecly could live without any music in my daily basics. That changed a lot last years. Now I have some use cases where the music is essential:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developing</li>
<li>Training (it doesn't matter inside or outside)</li>
<li>In the shower</li>
<li>Cooking, traveling...</li>
</ul>
<p>So I had a little problem with the playlists because they are difficult to be synced across multiple devices and different music players. It's a true nightmare if you want to have <em>the same</em>&nbsp;available <em>all the time</em>. But I guess it's posible and... free!.</p>
<p>On the desktop I'm used to play music with <code>cmus</code> - I think I've written <a href="https://www.userlinux.net/music-terminal-cmus-mpsyt.html">about this before</a> - because it's really light and it barely consumes computer resources. Ok, this is the only case where I have to build my playlists manually (or even that, continue reading). I've tried (and I have it installed) the <em>unofficial Google Play Music Desktop Player</em> and it's fine, but, far from being a battery drainer, it's not as tiny as cmus is. Desktop (and laptop) covers the "developing" cases, both, home and coffice.</p>
<p>On the mobile I was using <em>VLC</em> and some other players but in the end it was a waste of time to have to sync all the music all the time, update the playlists, etc... so in the end I decided to give a try to <em>Google Play Music</em>. As I was using it from time to time (the unofficial one) in Desktop, I have all the music there, so I can <em>download</em> to the phone the playlists I want to listen while I'm <em>offline</em>. That's perfect. The mobile covers all the other cases (training, shower, in the kitchen...) but the car (that's another history).</p>
<p><strong>In brief:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All the music is in my <code>Music/</code> folder, organized by folders, those folders are my local <em>playlists</em> because in cmus I treat the folders like playlists.</li>
<li>The Google Play Music watches the <code>Music/</code> folder and uploads automatically all the songs that appears in any subfolder there (you need the <a href="https://play.google.com/music/listen?u=0#/manager">Music Manager</a> installed in your computer).</li>
<li>I have to tag the songs in it's playlists once they're uploaded to <em>Google Play Music</em> and that's it.</li>
<li>Extra step: I can download the playlists just in <em>1-click</em> from the mobile if I run out of data connection.</li>
<li>Extra step 2: If the <code>Music/</code> folder is synced via <code>Owncloud</code>/<code>Nextcloud</code> the music is available even across many other devices too.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>PROS:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This stack is free, well, limited to 50.000 songs (by <em>Google Play</em>) but that's, by far, as free for me.</li>
<li>On the other hand, the left one to be more specific :D, I have the <a href="https://www.userlinux.net/set-garmin-vivoactive-hr-notifications-telegram.html">Garmin Vivoactive HR</a>, and there is a widget to control the Music Player of the smartphone, it runs really nice with the <em>Google Play</em> software, so with this extra feature, the stack is almost perfect for me.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>CONS:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I have to think twice which folder fits best for every song in my <code>Music/</code> local storage.</li>
<li>I have no automatic/automagic solution for the car. I need to manually sync the <code>Music/</code> folder to the USB drive I'm using there. Or just connect the smartphone to the AUX IN and see what happens (never tried, that thought just occurred to me as I write).</li>
</ul>

<p>And I think that's all folks, how do you manage with this? Feedback is always welcome.</p>
