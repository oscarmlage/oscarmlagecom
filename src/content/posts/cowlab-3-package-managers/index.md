<p>Yesterday night we had the 3rd meeting of our "<em>cowlab</em>". <a href="https://cowlab-lugo.github.io/">Cowlab</a> is a movement we started here in Lugo to keep in touch and organize some kind of events related with technology: it is a dynamic community with ideas inspired by the <em>Open Source</em> philosophy.</p>
<p>In this third edition three of us had agreed to make a talk about package managers in some of the most popular programming languages. <a href="http://nosolosoftware.com/">Andr&eacute;s</a> did the <em>Javascript</em> part talking about <code>npm</code>, <a href="https://www.dieg0v.com/">Diego</a> the <em>PHP</em> part with <code>composer</code> and I defended <em>Python</em> with <code>pip</code>.</p>
<p>I would like to thank <em>Andr&eacute;s</em> and <em>Diego</em> for the great stuff they created and all the fun we had during the preparation. Thanks to the attendants and a special mention to <a href="http://makerslugo.org/">makers.lugo</a> because they let us borrow the place to make this happen.</p>
<p>We have managed to publish all the stuff (slides, projects and some other surprise) in <a href="https://github.com/cowlab-lugo/packages">the official cowlab repo</a>. Feel free to use, share or distribute whatever you want there.</p>
<p>And, of course, I can not close this post without the photos.</p>
