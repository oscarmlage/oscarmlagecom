I've been applying patches lately. Not to the operating system, nor the load balancer. To myself.

Sometimes you drift into _degraded performance_ without even noticing, until something - or someone - triggers an alert. And then you have to check the logs, restart a few processes, clear some space.

There's not always a scheduled _downtime_. Sometimes maintenance has to be hot, with traffic coming in all the same. But you do what you can.

I've disabled some background services, and I'm monitoring the load. There's no magic fix, but some tweaks help. A little less noise, a little more pause.

I don't know when this scheduled task will finish, or whether I'll return with improved performance. But I'm still here, doing `uptime`, even if not everything is visible from the outside.

Thanks for sticking around.
