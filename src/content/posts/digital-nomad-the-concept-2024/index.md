As the wikipedia says, «_The term "digital nomad" started to be used in the early 1990s to describe a new type of high tech traveling lifestyle made possible by the growth of computer networking and popularization of mobile devices like laptops, tablets and PDAs._».

Today, in some classes I’m attending, we started talking about the digital nomad concept, asking if we knew about it and if we could name someone considered a digital nomad. It reminded me of the times I’ve mentioned it in the past.

I’ve been using the term `#digitalnomad` quite frequently, especially in my Instagram posts where I’d sneak it in whenever there was some tech gear paired with a picturesque background. In fact, I’ve been teased about it quite a few times. I admit, it was a bit of a bait, but I was young and immature.

When people hear the term _digital nomad_, they often think of someone hopping from one exotic location to another, working remotely from beaches, cafés, or coworking spaces in different countries. While that’s a romanticized view of the lifestyle, my take on digital nomadism is a bit different.

For me, being a _digital nomad_ isn’t about traveling constantly or changing locations every few weeks. Instead, it's about autonomy—being able to carry everything I need to work effectively, regardless of where I am. It’s about the freedom of having my _digital home_ with me at all times, packaged into a compact, highly portable setup. This allows me to work in any situation, whether it’s a crowded airport lounge, a quiet café, or even in the middle of nowhere in the country side.

This is where the concept of _Everyday Carry (EDC)_ comes into play. I’ve always been fascinated by the idea of minimizing what you carry to only the essentials, ensuring that you’re always ready to work, but without being weighed down. For a digital nomad, an efficient EDC is what enables that sense of flexibility and freedom. So, what’s part of my EDC for true digital nomadism? Here’s my list of must-haves:

### My Essential _Digital Nomad_ EDC:

1. **The backpack**  
    A lightweight, durable backpack is the foundation of any nomad setup. It needs to be compact enough to carry easily but spacious enough to fit all the necessary tools. It’s your mobile office in a bag.
2. **Laptop or iPad with Internet Access**  
    A computer is essential. Whether it’s a laptop or a high-powered tablet like an iPad, it should be capable of handling your work tasks, whether that’s writing code, managing projects, or accessing remote servers. Recently, I’ve been leaning towards the iPad because my laptop is anything but portable, and its battery leaves much to be desired. I’m happy using the iPad in these situations, as long as they’re not long coding sessions.
3. **A data plan for reliable Internet (MiFi or mobile tethering)**

Also, I’d like to mention some optional items that, while not strictly necessary, are definitely handy to have nearby just in case, to be fully prepared:

1. **A powerbank**
    Running out of battery is quite common when you're not "plugged in" all the time. A high-capacity power bank ensures that your devices can stay charged no matter where you are.
5. **Optional: A VPN**
    For many of us working in tech or other remote-access jobs, a secure VPN is non-negotiable. It not only keeps your data safe on public networks but also allows you to connect to the necessary remote servers and hosts to get your work done securely.

### Adapting to the new essentials

It’s possible that my *essentials* have changed a bit this year. While I no longer work from cafés as often as I used to (`:sadface:`), the last four months have forced me to deal with a home renovation situation. The constant back-and-forth has been a _great help_ in reducing my backpack to the bare minimum. So, it’s a funny coincidence that this topic has come up right now.
