<p>I was thinking about that feeling lately. It seems that I can not follow the wave out there, there are many things escaping from my comprehension due lack of time. Starting to talk about anything not related to my <em>day-by-day</em> is starting to feeling myself out of date.</p>
<p>Last days I could get some short time to read about a couple of topics - <em>frontend</em> related this time - and I felt like I was using <em>cobol</em> (nothing against <em>cobol</em> here). It's a fact you can not focus in every new brilliant and recently released piece of technology, but it's like there was an interestellar space between what I thought it was the right way and recent developments or best practices.</p>
<p>Probably have to go back to the old habit of taking Friday afternoons (or any other shift) as <em>research &amp; development</em>. Would be great.</p>
