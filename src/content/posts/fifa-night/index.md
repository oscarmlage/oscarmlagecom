Something I've been waiting for years finally happened tonight: for the first time, "the boys" and I were left alone at home, and the idea of *"playing some FIFA"* came up naturally. As cliché as it may sound, it was something I never planned to suggest myself, but I secretly hoped it would come up spontaneously from one of the kids.

So, we had a total FAIL of a dinner together (not everything had to go perfectly `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`), and then we spent almost three hours building some serious thumb calluses. It was incredibly fun — specially after I got used to the button layout on the Nintendo Switch.

What made the night special wasn’t just the laughter or the /friendly/ competition but the fact that it felt so effortless. It was a shared moment that needed no grand planning, no schedules, just us being together, enjoying this FIFA thing.

The rest will live on in my memory, and I really hope I don't have to wait as long to do it again.
