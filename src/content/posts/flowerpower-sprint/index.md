<p>In the project I'm working on we have a kind of "unwritten rule" in which - about twice a year - all the team must work together for some days, that's what we call "sprint". This time it was on Naxos, the largest of the Cyclades island group in the Aegean.</p>
<p>Trips were fine, I don't like to take planes but... pills did the job. After the flights we stayed one night at Pano's house in Athens, taking advantage of that we arranged a meeting with other guys related in a way with the project and had a really nice dinner. The next day, early in the morning, we spent 5 hours by boat to reach the island, we took with us - on the boat - a couple of motorbikes to move around the island.</p>
<p>Sascha and Rika were waiting for us, and after have lunch, reach the rental house and organize rooms and baggages... the sprint started. I could write thousands of words describing it day by day, but I'm sure I'm not able to describe all the feelings with words, so I think images are perfectly fine here to show how it was.</p>

<p>After this awesome experience I can only thank to Panos, Sascha and Rika for being best hosts ever... and to Borja of course to suffer my fears in first person ;).</p>
<p>The sprint was totally satisfactory - at least for me -, we've had lots of fun, lots of food, we finally met Grigori in person and lots of talks and work done. It's a really nice experience. The worst part are the goodbyes, difficult to handle such a distance between these friends and the day by day, I'm looking forward the next one. Can't wait.</p>
