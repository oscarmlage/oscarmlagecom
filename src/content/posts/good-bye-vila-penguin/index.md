Last photo of the family in front of the mirror in one of the rooms, saying definitely goodbye to 15 years of adventures. `Vila Penguin` was the nickname of our apartment (in tribute to *Dr. Slump*). It's gone, filled with memories and a whole life packed in boxes.

Let's go for the next level, thinking of a new nickname ;).
