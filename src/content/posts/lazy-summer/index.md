<p>There were almost no workouts during July + August, and September is starting the same way. We're experiencing too much changes with the kids school and the inestable weather here, so my body is feeling dumb, as my mind.</p>
<p>On the other hand we had a nice summer, traveling from here to there and enjoying weather, beach, friends and family. Enough to charge batteries and start thinking in next adventure.</p>
