<p>Last months are being tough over here, there are too many things beyond our control. Close people passed away, had the hardest flu that I can remember, had to quit jiujitsu classes, the other day the oculist said to me that both of my eyes requires surgery... c'mon... jam&oacute;n!.</p>
<p>For each one who begins to weep, somewhere else another stops. Life they say, but it hurts from time to time.</p>
<p>We're here to play and that's that.</p>
