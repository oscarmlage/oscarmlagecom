If memory serves me right, this is the first family trip we've taken since last summer. It's been a somewhat unusual winter, but in the end, we managed to break away from routine and enjoy a weekend in the capital with the excuse of seeing a musical we've been wanting to watch for a while. 

Every time I visit a big city, I feel like a little kid again, marveling at the buildings, and this time was no different.
