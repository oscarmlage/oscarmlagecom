And the day came when a part of the magic and innocence of Christmas was lost. At 12 years old, it feels as though something inside me has been taken away.

I hope I made the right choice. At this age, and with high school in the mix, handling it differently might have been even harsher.

As someone on Mastodon suggested, it’s a natural step—one that seems more traumatic for parents than for children. I couldn’t agree more.

I suppose it’s normal to feel this way as a parent. Still, I hope that next Christmas will be just as magical and beautiful as always. I’ll do my best to ensure that, even though everything has changed, it still feels like nothing has.
