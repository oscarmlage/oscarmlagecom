<p>A <a href="http://www.twitter.com/marcosbl">great friend of mine</a> adviced me about a bid during the Amazon Premium Day. We have been talking about monitors some time ago and he remembered I was searching a replacement for my 22" Benq.</p>
<p>It is a led monitor <a href="http://www.amazon.es/gp/product/B007Z1AWT6?psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s01">Acer G276HLA</a> with 27 inches and DVI + HDMI ports, you can read the other specifications in the <a href="http://www.acer.co.uk/ac/en/GB/content/model/UM.HG6EE.A01">Acer web</a>.</p>

<p>One of the "cons" is the max. allowed resolution (<em>1920x1080</em>), but as my Macbook Air (not the retina one) has that same value, it's good for me. After a couple of days using it, I'm totally adapted and I think I've done a good buy.</p>
