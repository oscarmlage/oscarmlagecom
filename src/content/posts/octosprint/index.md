<p>In agile programming "<em>sprint</em>" is the basic unit of development. But for us it means something more. In our team, a sprint is a period of time to work all together, have meetings, have fun and - in the end - improve the skills of the team and each of us.</p>
<p>We are used to make sprints twice a year and it's really nice. It helps a lot to speed up some stuff and in the other hand it's a perfect opportunity to practice some languages. Every sprint has it's own codename, t-shirts and, of course, tons of really good memories.</p>
<p>Last one was the <strong>OctoSprint</strong>, almost 10 days of code, coffee, food, surf (<em>wow</em>) and fun with friends. As I've said many times... I'm really happy and proud to be part of this team.</p>
<p>Happy sprinting and happy surfing!</p>
