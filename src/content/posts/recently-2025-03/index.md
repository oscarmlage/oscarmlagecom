Lately, I’ve been thinking about how time just flies when you’re juggling a bit of everything. March has been a mix of routines, small adventures, and moments that somehow end up sticking with you. Here’s a quick recap of what’s been going on lately

### 🏃‍♂️ Sports

This year the kids swapped basketball for handball, and they’re loving it!. Since there's only one team in our city, we’re hitting the road every other weekend to play matches around the region. The upside? We’re discovering small towns and new places that are surprisingly close to home but we didn't know.

On a personal note, 2025 is off to a solid start: I’ve completed all of the Apple Fitness monthly challenges for January, February, and March. Not huge achievements, maybe, but they’ve helped keep me motivated and consistent.

Gym-wise, I’m staying super regular and starting to notice progress, specially when it comes to intensity. I think that’s what’s really changed this year: not just showing up but pushing the limits.

### 🎮 Self-time

Path of Exile has pretty much taken over my spare time since early access launched in December. It's become my main escape lately — which I kind of need right now, if I’m being honest.

Professionally, I’m in a bit of a stagnant phase. It feels like I’m stuck in place, and I know I need to break out. The time is coming to close my eyes, take a deep breath, and just _jump_. Comfort zones are cozy, but they don’t get you far.

Also part of my personal escape: catching Breogán basketball games with my crew. It’s more than just watching a game — it’s the excuse we need to unwind and share laughs over a beer or two.

I went to a Mexican restaurant for the first time with the podcast (ex podcast actually) crew. I don’t usually have much to contribute compared to them when it comes to video games (they’re the real pros), but I helped get it started, and I’m glad they still make me feel part of the group.

### 🛠️ DIY

I’ve been playing around with my home setup and tried something new: two vertical monitors. Honestly? Loving it so far. It’s surprisingly comfortable for reading code, following help, or keeping some auxiliar stuff open without cranking my neck every five seconds.

On the DIY front, I built a motion-sensor lamp for the front entrance of the house. I used a Son-off switch, ran a couple of wires, and learned a bit more about electronics — a world I’ve always found fascinating but still don’t fully understand. One project at a time.

Oh, and speaking of the house: we had a tiny uninvited guest in the garage — a mouse. It gave us more than one headache, but after a few traps and some stealthy operations, we finally got it.

Finally, I did some much-needed maintenance on the van (not without a few headaches) and got it through its inspection. It’s now ready for whatever spring has in store.

It’s been a while since I last wrote a “Recently” post — and I’d almost forgotten how much I enjoy this format. So it felt like the right time to bring it back, take a moment to look around, and write it all down.
