It’s been nearly impossible to work in the office lately. The heatwave hitting Spain has made my usual setup (comfy chair, dual monitors, perfect lighting) feel more like a sauna than a workspace.

So, in the spirit of adaptation, I’ve started a new habit. Every morning, I grab my laptop and head downstairs, where the temperature is a few degrees cooler and the air feels a little more forgiving. I set up at the dining table, no fancy setup, just enough space to type and think clearly. And my laptop seems grateful too... no more fans spinning like turbines.

To complete the ritual, I’ve added a new daily essential: iced coffee with milk. It’s simple, refreshing, and weirdly satisfying.

Sometimes, it’s not about having the perfect environment, it’s about making just enough changes to keep going. This setup may be temporary, but for now, it’s keeping me sane and functional.
