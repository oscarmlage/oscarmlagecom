I've finally managed to make a few small changes to this site that I've been wanting for a while. There were certain small details that didn’t quite convince me, and with each passing day, I felt a growing need to try and adjust them. These are minor adjustments, but they make the site feel more enjoyable to me.

- I’ve removed my image/avatar from the homepage since I was never fully convinced by it.
- The main menu has been switched from text to icons.
- Font sizes have been adjusted to improve readability.
- Margins and spacings have been refined to better fit the new changes.
- The footer has been minimized, now using icons instead of text.
- All content has been aligned to the center across all possible screen resolutions.

These aren't big updates, but I really like the theme’s foundation, so I just made a few subtle tweaks to make it feel a little more personal.

Looking ahead, I’m excited to continue experimenting with design and functionality, always aiming for a cleaner interface.
