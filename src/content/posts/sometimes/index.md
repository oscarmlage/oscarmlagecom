Sometimes, things don’t turn out as planned. Not how you expected, not how you hoped, and certainly not how you envisioned them. Sometimes, life forces you to question motivations that feel irrational or outcomes that are beyond your control, things that aren’t tied to your effort, your decisions, or your intentions.

Sometimes, you watch yourself shrink, becoming smaller and smaller, as you search for clarity that never quite comes, for explanations that refuse to make sense. Sometimes, life is simply about facing it... about finding a way to say `keep pushing` because you know that’s what you’re supposed to do, even when it feels impossible.

Sometimes, the hardest battles aren’t visible.

Sometimes.
