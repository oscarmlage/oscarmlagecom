<p>Bunch of years ago, when social networks did not exist (<em>wow</em>) the web prettended to be pretty simple. As simple that some content management systems were designed to do a kind of hard work: build a static site from the dynamic one. Easier to be served, maintained and much much faster... win-win!.</p>
<p>Now, bunch of years later, we're going back to our roots. And I intend the same too.</p>
<p>For me, or rather, for my use case with this humble site, it doesn't make sense to keep maintaining it as it is now, a super-outdated <em>django</em> own-cms with many complex elements to connect with <em>redis</em>, <em>mysql</em>, some kind of <em>memcache</em> stuff in the middle of nowhere and some other stuff I'm shamed to write about. The goal has been achieved long ago: play a bit with the more popular python framework.</p>
<p>I've been playing - and still playing - with some of these tools that keeps the work static and it's really hard to decide which one fits better my needs, because they're all quite similar. For the record:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank">Hugo</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.getlektor.com/" target="_blank">Lektor</a></li>
<li><a href="https://getnikola.com/" target="_blank">Nikola</a></li>
<li><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/" target="_blank">Gatsby</a></li>
<li><a href="https://vuepress.vuejs.org/" target="_blank">VuePress</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.11ty.dev/" target="_blank">Eleventy</a></li>
</ul>
<div>
<p>Will see what is the one that leads the victory.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>On the other hand I even didn't decided if <a rel="noopener" href="../../../../" target="_blank">userlinux</a> will be the domain/name because the archive of posts here are not relevant anymore and I rarely talk about linux. I feel more comfortable with <a rel="noopener" href="https://oscarmlage.com" target="_blank">oscarmlage</a> so... I need to sleep on it.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>But what I've already decided is that - definitely - it's time to move. Or rather, it's time to stay static ;).</p>
