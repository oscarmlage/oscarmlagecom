Spent almost the whole summer away from the keyboard. Thought it would recharge me, but it didn’t. The few times I had to log in it felt wrong: anxiety, palpitations, zero joy.

Maybe the romance is over… or maybe it’s just the bad times before vacation still present, and I need to give it more time to feel the joy in my fingers again.
