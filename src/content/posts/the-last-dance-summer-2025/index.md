The bikes, left scattered on the grass.  The sunset glowing between the houses, as the kids squeeze the very last hours out of their summer rides.

Itâ€™s been an incredible summer, specially for them. Friends, trips, endless games, and experiences that will now have to wait a whole year to come back again.

A chapter closed, with memories that -hopefully- will shine bright until the next summer opens its doors.
