<p>Fashion today is rant on about Apple.</p>
<p>No matter what they do or what they did in the past, rant is the easiest way. I do not agree with some products or some strategies they're releasing every single year but most of the products are best suited to my needs.</p>
<p>I'm totally sure new Mac Pro and new Pro Display XDR fits to some other people out there, and comparing them to other professional products (not gaming or personal computers), they seems even cheap.</p>
<p>I'm not talking about the stand, that is a quite different story.</p>
<p>But hey, let the people do - and buy - whatever they want, to have different tastes makes us better and allows us to evolve, in technological terms.</p>
