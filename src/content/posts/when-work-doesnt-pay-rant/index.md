Lately, I’ve been going through something that’s made me realize just how fragile a worker’s position can be. Without getting into names or numbers, it’s the classic situation: months of doing a job, showing up, contributing, meeting expectations - and yet, no paycheck. Not once. Not twice. Several months. No clarity. No security.

I consulted a lawyer, because I want to defend what I’ve rightfully earned through my time, skills, and effort; and even with the law on my side, the process of claiming what’s owed is filled with costs, hurdles, and small print.

And here comes the part that really stings:

- If I want to exercise my rights, I have to pay a percentage of **my own salary** to a lawyer.
- If I go through a union, there are still fees, percentages, waiting periods.
- If the company declares insolvency, I have to settle for what a public fund (*FOGASA*) decides to cover, which is **not 100% of what I’m owed**.
- And all the while, I remain contractually bound, unpaid, and unable to move on without risking what I’m still entitled to.

Where is the real protection for workers? What kind of justice system turns **getting paid for work already done** into a privilege rather than a guaranteed right?

I get that lawyers charge for their services. But why on earth should it be a **cut of your salary**, money you earned under your own conditions, good or bad? Why can’t they just give you a: “*This will take X hours, here’s my rate, this is the cost*”? Charging a percentage feels outdated. And deeply unfair.

It shouldn’t be this hard to get what’s already yours. It shouldn’t depend on whether or not you can afford justice. Because your time doesn’t come back. And what you earn with it **should never be negotiable**.

The fact that this even needs to be said is exhausting. Anyway, just needed to get that off my chest.

«Justice — as long as you can afford it».
