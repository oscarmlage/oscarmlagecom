# ¡Hola!, I'm Óscar

Hi, I’m a freelance full-stack developer and sysadmin based in **Lugo, Spain** 💻. With years of experience in system engineering and software development, I’m passionate about leveraging automation to enhance efficiency ⚙️, focusing primarily on systems, backend development, and creating scalable solutions.

You’ll often find me exploring the console—my black-and-white terminal to rule the world 🖤—or working on self-hosted projects in my homelab 🏡. Whether it’s crafting solutions with Python, Go, and PHP 🐍 or orchestrating infrastructure with Docker and Ansible 🐳, I’m always on the lookout for tools and technologies that drive productivity and growth.

Off the keyboard, I enjoy woodworking 🌟, gardening 🌱, and coding from my van 🚐. Oh, and I’m also a proud dad of twins 👬🏻.

If you’d like to connect or collaborate, feel free to <a href="mailto:info[@]oscarmlage[.]com">✉️ drop me an email</a>.
