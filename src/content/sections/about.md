# ¡Hola!, I'm Óscar

I'm an experienced professional in system engineering and software development based in *Lugo*, Spain. I'm committed to leveraging automation to enhance efficiency, primarily focusing on systems, backend development and always exploring new tools for continuous learning and growth. I'm passionate about the console, a black-and-white terminal to rule the world. If you would like to get in touch, you can <a href="mailto:info@oscarmlage.com">✉️ drop me an email</a>.
