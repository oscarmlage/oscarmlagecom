This site has been built on top of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), [Vim](https://www.vim.org), [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki), [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/oscarmlage) (did almost everything live!, since the Hugo research to the last fill of text placeholders) and of course, ❤️ and ☕. Oh! and [the repo](https://github.com/oscarmlage/oscarmlagecom) is public now.

**Let me specially highlight that all of this was possible because [Segundo Fdez](https://www.segundofdez.com) has given me his best gift: time, effort and the knowledge to make this great interface you're looking at. Thank you so much ❤️**
