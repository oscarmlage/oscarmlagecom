List of things that I don't like or I don't want to do. At the risk of a negative first impression, here it is, the controversial "nope page".

- Listen to people that only talks about themselves.
- Talking on the phone, no matter the reason, no matter the circumstance.
- The internet as we know it today, full of ads and pop-ups everywhere.
- Changing the context too often.
- Using a computer without a proper keyboard/monitor, I recently discovered this.
- Overly verbose talks about biking, crossfit or running stuff.
- WhatsApp.
- People not keeping their promises in any kind of context.
