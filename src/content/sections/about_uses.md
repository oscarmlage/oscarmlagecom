I’m writing this on a **Keychron K7 Pro**, staring at a **Samsung C34J791**, a 34-inch curved monitor with a resolution of 3440x1440 at 100Hz. It’s connected via Thunderbolt to a **MacBook Pro**—the last Intel generation, a beast equally capable of devouring tasks and churning out heat, with fans and battery life paying the price.

For lighter development sessions or during my travels in the van 🚐, I often switch to a **2018 iPad Pro**, which is much kinder to my back.
